# Musa Guesser
Guess [Musa](http://musa.bet) spellings based on Wikipedia pronunciation.

Looks on Wikipedia to guess the pronunciation of a place name, then tries to transliterate it into Musa.

Largely superseded by [the Musa IPA transcriber](http://musa.bet/transcripa.htm) and the [Musa dictionary (bottom of page)](http://musa.bet/downloads.htm).
